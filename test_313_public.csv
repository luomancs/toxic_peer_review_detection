"However, these issues are not convincing as no citations or theoretical proof is provided in this paper.",0,,,,
The notations in the intro are also not well-defined.,1,1,,,
The technical contribution is very incremental.,1,1,,,
The ''inducing point variational approximation of the GP predictive distribution'' referred as inducing point GP is not clear for me.,0,,,,
All these important points are not clarified in the introduction.,0,,,,
The theoretical contributions are also not well-organized.,1,1,,,
The author fails to prove that the spectral normalization as a regularization scheme can be uses to mitigate uncertainty collapse.,1,,1,,
I also have some concerns on the experimental results of causal inference.,1,1,,,
The most severe issue is lacking novelty.,1,1,,1,
"It is a straightforward combination of existing work, therefore, the contribution of this work is rare.",1,,,1,
"Moreover, some of the claims in the paper are not appropriate.",1,1,,,
"For example, using random features to approximate the kernel function does not bring extra stochasticity.",0,,,,
The random features are fixed once sampled from the base measure of the corresponding kernel.,0,,,,
"Basically, you can view the random feature approximation as a linear combination of fixed nonlinear basis which are sampled from some distribution.",0,,,,
"Unless I am missing something important, or misunderstanding something, I do not really understand what is significant about this work, and I don't see it as having originality.",1,,1,1,
"If the authors insist on making the reader figure this out by deduction, I recommend they just write ""We leave the symbols-operation mapping as a small puzzle for the reader.""",1,,1,,
"But significance of this is not really discussed in any depth other than being mentioned in corresponding places in the text, i.e. it's not really the focal story of the text. ",0,,,,
"Unless I am missing an important point, the results are unsurprising, and I am not clear what is novel or significant about them.",1,1,,1,
"One obvious concern with this is that this produces a sequence of open-loop plans, rather than a closed-loop policies, with all the inherent limitations.",0,,,,
"For Figure 2, it seems that the only analysis of the results is the last sentence before the conclusion, that ""Smaller numbers of goal facts tend to be quite easy, larger ones mostly infeasible, with variance depending on the domain and algorithm.""",1,,1,,
"There seems to be a dilemma between soft and hard attention -- the soft attention is more expressive, however,  it also under-performs hard attention in some experiments. ",0,,,,
"However, it seems that the authours just apply this already proposed method to the task of MI EEG classification and the whole method lacks novelty.",1,1,1,,
"Besides,  causal reasoning is not well descrbed in the paper except Eq.(3) which is not enough for self-contained and Z is not stated in your pipeline (Fig. 2",0,,,,
I'm a bit unhappy with how the entailment experiments were set up.,1,1,1,,
"Instead of this, you end up plugging in a (heurisitic) ground metric and computing embeddings.",0,,,,
"This seems haphazard, and I'm not terribly convinced this makes sense.",1,,1,1,
The paper has a fairly straightforward main story and positive results; the addition of these remarks just detract from the rest of the paper.,1,,1,,
The explanation surrounding equation 4 is fairly confusing,1,1,,,
I'm also not sure if summing normalized SPPMI values makes sense as an object.,0,,,,
"Hence, one potential application could be in checking for the implicit bias in point estimates (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) and then correcting it via the ground cost.' - this is a pretty vacuous statement - you could have compared pairwise distances for word embeddings to correct it, for example.",1,,,1,
I honestly think the throwaway comments like this one and the one above should just be stripped from the paper.,1,,1,1,
The section 'Relation between the histogram and point estimates.' is similarly vacuous.,1,1,,1,
I really do not think pointing this out adds much insight to your paper.,1,,1,,
In fact i'd argue that it's not a terribly enlightening - what is the ground truth supposed to look like?,0,,,,
The cons are that their proposed method can learn proposals only for a simple stochastic process and do note that they recieve poor results on rare instances from their X distribution as well as their approach not being able to improve the quality  of pre-trained proposals.,1,,1,1,
"""pair of patches of 32x32x32, cropped around the center of the annotated nodules at both time-points"" & ""the radiologists detected and matched the most relevant nodule and annotated its malignancy"": while this is a quite impressive cohort and annotation work, sampling a single nodule per scan remains limited.",0,,,,
I found this paper to be poorly premised.,1,1,,1,
This statement is incorrect.,1,1,,,
This is entirely confusing.,1,1,1,,
There are further fundamental issues that crop up throughout the paper.,1,1,,,
"This is not a novel insight, in my opinion.",1,1,,,
It is not clear how the preliminary experiments demonstrate the benefit of their approach.,0,,,,
Accuracy of intent classification across time‚ÄîI believe this is not reported anywhere.,0,,,,
But the underlying motivation is not justified,0,,,,
The notation $R_u$ was not explained.,0,,,,
T The provided images are too small and low-resolution to show any useful details.,0,,,,
$c$ is never defined,0,,,,
why do you have a variable $x$ that seems identical to $c$?,0,,,,
I would expect $c$ to be a constant if it is a parameter to the env but that would make solving the problem impossible since it needs to know state,0,,,,
this is confusing and showing the full 500 would be better,0,,,,
I didn't fully understand why magnitude of $s1 / s2$ will make a big difference,0,,,,
why don't you demonstrate your CL methods on this?,0,,,,
"The examples shown in the paper under review, in contrast, are of quite limited scale, and to my understanding do not represent the current state of the art.",1,1,,,
"The examples shown in the paper under review, in contrast, are of quite limited scale, and in contrast don't seem able to show the full structure which we now know to be present in deepnet spectra across a very wide range of networks and datasets at full scale.",0,,,,
"In short, the paper is not properly written nor well organized; is hard to read with vague contributions and vague positioning with respect to the state of the art.",1,,,1,
Experiments are not convincing: Toy experiment and minimum experiments in MNIST without a clear comparison to existing neuron pruning algorithms.,0,,,,
"However, the novelty of this paper is limited.",1,1,,,
"The experiments, which only include edge to shoes and MNIST to SVHN, are also not comprehensive and convincing.",1,1,1,1,
This paper also lacks discussion of several quite important related references for one-to-many image translation.,0,,,,
"Perhaps the authors are not used to submitting to MIDL-like conferences, as the paper lacks some essential components to it. Such as the description of the models/data used, comparison, experimental set-up, citations.",1,,,,1
The main issue is the lack of novelty.,1,1,,,
"The proposed method is just a straightforward dimensionality reduction based on_x000D_
convolutional and max pooling layers.",1,,1,,
Using CNNs to handle variable length time series is hardly novel.,1,1,,,
"If the metric is not used in some compelling application, I am not convinced.",1,1,,,
I find this assumption absurd.,1,1,1,1,
"However, I find two major shortcomings in the method.",0,,,,
"The title is misleading, since only two particular manifolds are studied in this work.",1,,1,,
There are multiple problem definitions proposed in the paper.,1,1,,,
"In addition, some of the proposed problem definitions are incorrect, as explained below:",0,,,,
"In the contribution (2): It is not clear why and how the proposed method can be applied to optimization on manifolds with momentum (what do you mean by use of momentum here?), and regularization (what do you mean by regularization?).",0,,,,
"Therefore, you should completely change your claims on your problem definitions and contributions.",1,,1,1,
"In your claim ""From the construction of bk, we can see that the smaller the correlation between gradf(xk) and hk is, the smaller effect the information from M2 brings""¬ù, it is not clear how ""the information from M2""¬ù affects?",0,,,,
The statements regarding batch normalization are confusing and also sound incorrect:,0,,,,
There are not such results in the papers Cho & Lee (2017); Huang et al. (2017) you cited for these results.,0,,,,
"In your notation, together with explanation of the notation for St(n,p), G(1,n) is like a set of 1xn dimensional row vectors, while St(n,1) is an nx1 dimensional column vector, Then, their intersection is an empty set and your proposal for optimization on a vector on their intersection is wrong. ",0,,,,
Notation and definitions used in (9) are wrong and confusing.,1,1,,1,
"Then, suddenly, you start considering optimization on product manifolds, and give the results for that;",1,,1,,
What do you mean by optimization on product manifold of weights of all layers?,0,,,,
Which problem is solved to perform these experiments is not also clear (see above).,0,,,,
"The results reported in the paper are also not good, may be due to the mathematical and algorithmic  problems and errors mentioned above.",1,1,,1,
"However, it may not be a good fit for the topic of this workshop.",0,,,,
"The idea of the paper is interesting, but the work is not solid enough.",0,,,,
"The loss (10), which the authors claim that they are using, may not work.",1,1,,,
The inference procedure is too simple that it can hardly find the near-optimal solutions.,0,,,,
"However, the most important part, the possibly problematic loss is not resolved.",0,,,,
"The RGB encoding is entirely arbitrary, unnecessary, and confusing.",1,,1,1,
"They motivated such a setting with an example of Google image search. However, such a setting is quite limited.",0,,,,
Some of the findings are not quite surprising.,1,1,,,
The approximation also raises concerns regarding the convergence of the algorithm.,0,,,,
"However, this does not necessarily guarantee the correctness of the recovered factor matrices (input to the BNN).",0,,,,
 Factorization using the proposed method is not unique (up to rescaling and permutation of the factor matrices). ,0,,,,
There are a few claims that do not necessarily serve the argument:,0,,,,
"While the presented method is interesting with high performance, I found many editorial errors in the writing.",0,,,,
There are so many errors like this and the paper needs serious rewriting.,1,,,1,
Figure 3 is unclear if the blue line is without TBV with the legend 'Right corridor visited'.,0,,,,
Reference format seems to have errors since there are underlines.,0,,,,
"As a result, there doesn't appear to be any additional content or insights above and beyond this original work.",0,,,,
"For instance, almost all the figures are derived from the original paper, and I actually found the original blogpost from the ICLR2022 paper more informative, as it includes a worked example demonstrating the workflow of MIDI-DDSP with synthesised audio examples and audible comparisons with prior work.",0,,,,
"As a secondary note, there are also errors/typos in this blogpost. To list a few:",0,,,,
"Subsequently, I don't think this fits the requirements for the ICLR blogpost track.",0,,,,
"However, the originality of the proposed method itself is not clear from the theoretical and practical viewpoints.",0,,,,
There is no comparison between the pre-existing baseline method.,0,,,,
"Though the EFE-based approach is very interesting, the authors did not succeed in providing evidence of the advantage of the proposed method.",0,,,,
It is questionable if this experiment is suitable for evaluating the main argument of this paper.,1,1,,,
"The definition of ""global preference"" is not given.",0,,,,
"However, they did not provide any explicit discussion over ""inverse RL.""",0,,,,
I see some problems with the proposed approach.,1,1,,,
"First of all, the proposed metric is computationally very expensive since 2,000 models need to be trained for each s.",0,,,,
"At s=70,80,90%, there will be a lot of overlap of samples among 2,000 subsets and I don't see much value in distinguishing such cases (70%, 80%, 90%) with such fine granularity.",0,,,,
Taking an average over uniform s seems ad hoc to me.,1,1,,,
"- My main point of criticism: The intrinsic dimension is *the* central quantity_x000D_
of your paper, but the definition you provide in lines 32-35 is quite vague and_x000D_
therefore not sufficient in my opinion.",1,,,1,
"This makes it hard to_x000D_
distinguish different weight decay values.",0,,,,
Figure 1: the text in the bubbles is too small to read.,0,,,,
Definition 1: the gap between the end of this and the start of the next paragraph looks like its somehow formatted oddly?,0,,,,
Definition 2: Your equations mess w/ the padding of the line.,0,,,,
"Despite this, we are not enthusiastic about the paper for the following reasons:_x000D_
Narrow and incomplete view of commonly used modern RNA-seq tools/pipelines and their application/use in biomedical research.",1,,1,,
The proposed computational method is computationally intractable and is unlikely to ever scale to the genome-wide context.,0,,,,
Described experiments are without context to the existing literature of tools designed to address the biological challenge and by construction are not annotation free.,0,,,,
Narrow and incomplete view of RNA-seq tools/pipelines/application:,0,,,,

Sequencing is of cDNA after reverse transcription, not RNA.",0,,,,
Ignores paired end reads (especially with longer insert sizes for fusion detection),0,,,,
"Shredder poor analogy given multiple distinct reads from same sequence, known biases in process",1,1,,,
We see the fact that there is no obvious map from the proposed method back to genetic information as a weakness.,0,,,,
Proposed computational method computationally intractable and unlikely to scale to genome-wide context,0,,,,
Unclear how patterns will hold when considering k-mers from more genes simultaneously or how embedding could scale.,0,,,,
"Abstract states that ""learned representation both useful for visualization as well as analysis""¬ù. Unclear what is done with model/embeddings besides visualization -- non-visual analyses are performed with k-mer counts before embedding.",0,,,,
"Identification of abnormalities are described only by visual inspection, which is unlikely to scale as more k-mers are added and/or if the dimensionality of the embedding increases.",0,,,,
Experiments without context to existing literature and are not annotation free,0,,,,
The paper does not describe existing methods using annotations designed to address tasks/applications suggested for the new model.,0,,,,
The paper does not compare developed model to these existing methods.,0,,,,
"In this regard, the absence of any note or methods describing how reads were mapped (what method, with which parameters) to reference (which reference genome, which gene annotations) is a serious limitation.",0,,,,
"Thus, claim that, as a consequence, ""kmer2vec captures real genomic abnormalities and allows to extract directly from the kmer embedding space the abnormal sequence""¬ù is unsubstantiated.",0,,,,
The paper is a little too focused on the packet routing example domain and fails to deliver much in terms of a general theory of reward design for cooperative behaviours beyond showing that mixed rewards can lead to improved results in their domain.,0,,,,
"It feels like there is a missing section between sections 2 and 3, where this methodological content could be described.",0,,,,
"The rest of the paper has similar issues, with key intuition and concepts either missing entirely or under-represented.",1,1,,,
"The technical content often assumes that the reader is familiar with certain terms, and it is difficult to see what meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evaluation.",1,1,,,
"However, more importantly, the authors really needed to do more to synthesize this into an overall picture of what principles are at play and what ideas/methods exist that have tried to exploit some of these principles.",1,,1,,
"""¬¢ [p2] the authors say ""We set the meta reward signals as 1 - max(U l )."", before they define what U_l is.",0,,,,

"""¬¢ [p6] ""Importantly, the proposed blR seems to have similar capacity with dlR,"" The discussion here is all in terms of the reward acronyms with very little call on intuition or other such assistance to the reader.",0,,,,
"Overall, it was difficult to understand the main approach presented in the paper.",1,1,,,
It was unclear as to the kind of environments that were being considered in the approach.,0,,,,
"As it stands, it does not give too much to the SPARK community, as I struggle to see how the proposed approaches can be used in different domains.",0,,,,
The main issue with this computation is that it provides a distance between a set of words but not a sequence of words.,0,,,,
"- Introduction ""OT [...] providing a natural measure of distance for sequences comparisons"": it is not clear why this statement is true.",0,,,,
This paper lacks any novelty/contribution as it just applies well-known and standard architectures for object detection (SSD) and image classification (LeNet) trained with standard algorithms and losses.,1,,1,1,
"Moreover, I fail to see what is the purpose of the proposed pipeline and it is not clear at all how it may help improving existing OCR engines in any particular scenario (handwriting recognition, printed text, historical documents, etc.).",1,1,1,1,
No demonstration or comparison with state of the art is provided.,0,,,,
"The authors claim ""This work is the first to apply modern object detection deep learning approaches to document data""¬ù but there are previously published works.",1,1,,,
"Actually, in my opinion Music Object Detection in musical scores would be a much better test-bed/application for the proposed pipeline than any of the datasets used in this paper.",0,,,,
The datasets used in the experimental section seem to be created ad-hoc for the proposed pipeline and do not come from any real world application.,0,,,,
"Finally, the presentation of the paper is marginal.",1,1,,,
"Data plots have very bad resolution, there are no captions in any table or figure and they are not correctly referenced within the text.",0,,,,
There seem to be also missing content in the last sections which makes them impossible to read/understand.,1,1,,,
"* The authors state that the embedding is unsupervised, but in Appendix C they acknowledge that it is trained with early-stopping based on the final classification accuracy, thereby relying on an implicit supervision.",0,,,,
"* This method does not improve over the state-of-the-art on time-series classification, even though it is its natural purpose",1,1,1,,
 * The experimental validation of the proposed method is weak (cf detailed method).,1,1,,,
"Taking into consideration these aspects, I tend to vote for a weak rejection.",0,,,,
"- On a conceptual level, the ideas underlying the use of a triplet loss explained in the 3rd paragraph of section 2 seems a bit incomplete to me.",0,,,,
"This seems contradictory, because if they belong to the same global time-series, they are both sub-series of the global time-series and therefore should be close.",0,,,,
"Also, the fact that no scale is taken into account when defining sub-series seems quite irrealistic.",0,,,,
"It is a pity that the importance of this value is not reported, as it would have provided an intuition on its importance.",1,,1,,
- The runtimes reported in Table 1 are a bit strange.,0,,,,
"Why does the runtime of the raw values vary so much (x30) when moving from daily to quarterly predictions, while the runtime of the representations diminishes (/3)?",0,,,,
"If so your phrase ""is zero given a sequence of inputs X1, ...,T"" is misleading.",0,,,,
2. Lack of motivation for IE or UIE.,0,,,,
"I do not understand why we would like to assume (1), (2), (3).",0,,,,
"3. The paper proposed the new architecture RIN, but it is not much different than a simple RNN with identity initialization.",0,,,,
Not much novelty.,1,1,,,
4. The experimental results are not convincing.,1,1,,,
It's not compared against any previous published results.,0,,,,
E.g. the addition tasks and sMNIST tasks are not as good as those reported in [1].,0,,,,
I am not sure if the paper is relevant to the XAIP Workshop.,1,1,,,
But the authors made no attempt to make that stance.,1,,,1,
"Even if that is the case, there is plenty of existing work [1] where the agent tries to make the goal or plan recognition task easier for the observer.",1,1,1,,
"Another consequence of this degeneracy concerns the latent variable interpretation of the IB: if T is treated as a latent variable (as, for instance, in the ""deep"" IB models) then we have the conditional independence relation ""Y independent of X given T"", which simply makes no sense if Y is deterministic in X (there is, of course, a deeper underlying problem here: the IB problem is difficult in that it is difficult to define a geneative model with a faithful DAG...).",1,,1,1,
"In particular, I strongly disagree with the statement that ""in most classification problems, the labels Y are a deterministic function of X"".",0,,,,
"However, the paper is poorly written and hard to follow, and the proposed model lacks of novelty.",1,1,,,
"1) In model section, the task definition is not clear.",1,1,,,
"2) The encoder and decoder are not novel, it is expected to cite and compare with the existing similar encoder architecture, such as the encoder proposed in bidaf ""Seo, Minjoon, et al. ""Bidirectional attention flow for machine comprehension."" arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.01603 (2016).""",0,,,,
"The decoder description is not clear as well and expected to compare with existing work (e.g., bidaf) to show the difference.",0,,,,
3) The proposed copy mecahnism is not clear.,1,1,,,
"The authors stated ""using a modified heuristic described below"", but no follow-ups in the paper.",0,,,,
5) The paper is not well written and organized.,1,1,,,
"Small typos: in introduction, 'and and answer span', 'and output and output sequences'.",0,,,,
The problem statement is unclear and informal throughout most of the paper.,1,1,,,
"Towards the end the reader gets an idea in retrospect, but the involved concepts remain vague.",1,1,,,
The motivation remains unclear.,1,1,,,
"No plausible use case for the orientation dependent definition of ""hollow body"" is given.",0,,,,
"Then paper mentions (quite extensively!) 3D display technology as well as CAD systems, but ultimately no connection to these is made.",1,,1,,
There are numerous language and grammar errors.,1,1,,,
"At times this makes it hard to even make sense of the text, or to be certain things are understood as intended.",1,,1,1,
"Robustness (with respect to non-uniforn sampling, noise, etc.) is not addressed or discussed.",0,,,,
Their choice is not discussed.,0,,,,
"This, together with the various formal clarity issues, hinders reproducibility of the method and the results.",0,,,,
"Overall, the paper's presentation is of a quality and clarity that is not acceptable for publication.",1,,,1,
The paper's contribution is quite limited and its potential significance remained open.,1,1,,,
"The paper is very hard to read, full of sentences that are not at all easy to parse (let alone make sense of) and concepts coming out of nowhere.",1,1,1,1,
There are way too many inaccuracies and plainly wrong statements.,1,1,1,1,
"* The characterization of heuristics is wrong: search heuristics are implicitly understood to take into account, in one form or another, the goal of the problem, so it makes no sense to talk, as the authors do, of using goal information in the computation of the heuristic as a novel contribution.",1,,1,1,
"* The authors do not make clear in which sense translating a web service composition problem to PDDL loses ""much of the semantics on the way""¬ù.",0,,,,
"* ""Uniform action costs""¬ù is not a heuristic; the way in which it is presented as an admissible heuristic makes no sense at all.",1,,1,1,
"The sentence is not too clear, but it certainly gives the incorrect impression that the heuristic does not apply to problems with delete effects, which is not the case.",0,,,,
"* Standard concepts from the planning literature such as ""post-uniqueness""¬ù, ""binariness""¬ù, ""open world assumption""¬ù are brought into the discussion out of nowhere, with no clear relation to what is being discussed.",0,,,,
But no heuristic found so far has used the semantics of the planning problem.,0,,,,
"Thus, those heuristics are often not applicable to general planning in real-world problems""¬ù ",0,,,,
"It is not clear nor explained elsewhere in which sense the heuristics do not ""use the semantics of the planning problem""¬ù, let alone why they are not applicable to ""general planning in real-world problems""¬ù.",0,,,,
* No formalization at all of the problem that is being tackled is given.,1,,1,,
"Unfortunately I couldn't make much sense of the previous, e.g. it is not clear to me at all in what is the meaning of ""PDDL with few semantics""¬ù, of "" input and output parameter type class hierarchies""¬ù, and so on.",1,,1,,
The above is but a quick sample.,0,,,,
"Overall, the paper does not meet the standards of clarity, scholarship and relevance of the workshop, and hence I propose rejection.",1,,,1,
The technical novelty is not significant,1,1,,,
It is a combination of known prior methods: imitation learning + ppo (prior RL work).,0,,,,
The presented exploration task is not properly justified as to how it could be useful for the navigation task.,0,,,,
Overall the novelty of the approach and the proposed problem is incremental.,0,,,,
The paper has major short comings in the experimental section.,1,1,,,
The presented experiments do not support the main claim of the paper which is improving the performance in the well-known navigation task.,0,,,,
Major baselines are missing.,1,1,,,
"Also, the provided results are not convincing in doing the right comparison with the baselines. **",1,1,,,
The major experimental evaluations (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) are based on the m^2 coverage after k steps and the plots are cut at 1000 steps.,0,,,,
"There is a huge list of prior methods for navigation some of which are cited in the ""learning for Navigation""¬ù section of the related works and the comparison provided in Fig. 4 is incomplete compared to the state-of-the-arts in navigation.",0,,,,
The aforementioned paper is also missed in the references.,0,,,,
Technical details are missing or not explained clearly,1,1,,,
- Section 3.1 does not clearly explain the map construction.,0,,,,
The point of this sentence is unclear.,0,,,,
-The left and right plots of the Figure 3 contains lots of repetitions which brings in confusion in comparing the performance of runs with different settings.,0,,,,
"- Interpretation of ""green vs white vs black""¬ù in the reconstructed maps is left to the reader in Fig. 1.",0,,,,
-A big list papers for 3D map reconstruction is missing.,1,1,,,
"Unfortunately, the experiments are seriously lacking in my opinion, as I believe *the major focus* of those experiments should be comparisons to other denoising / regularization techniques.",0,,,,
1. Description of the forward model is limited and it is unclear if it is learned from data.,0,,,,
In the orange line in Figure 2 (the line associated to the standard CNN) I do not see the std.,0,,,,
"There are no comparisons or reasonable baselines of any kind, and the reported results are a bit hard to judge.",1,1,,1,
"As far as I can understand, there are no quantitative results in simulation at all, and the real-world results are not good, indicating something like 15 degrees of error in predicting the pose of a single object.",0,,,,
"That doesn't seem especially good, though it's also very hard to tell without a baseline.",1,1,,,
One point about style: I found the somewhat lofty claims in the introduction a bit off-putting.,1,1,,,
"It's great to discuss the greater ""vision"" behind the work, but this paper suffers from a bit too much high-level vision and not enough effort put into explaining what the method actually does.",0,,,,
"While an 85% compression rate is significant, 88% accuracy on MNIST seems poor.",0,,,,
 Figure 3 is low resolution and difficult to read.,0,,,,
"While the revised version contains more experimental details, the paper in its present form lacks comparisons to other gaze selection and saliency models which are required to put results in context.",0,,,,
"It seems the attacker is seemingly completely oblivious to the actual network, and parameters being used, and only measures his current success rate, and seems very naive. ",1,1,,,
There is no theoretical contribution in the paper and all the arguments are heuristically based on some intuition about training dynamics.,1,,,1,
"In short, in my opinion the paper is simply not relevant or strong enough to warrant acceptance at ICLR.",1,,,1,
"In fact, it does not address the real challenge in distributed training of GNNs.",1,1,,,
"However, this method only focuses on the former one. ",0,,1,,
"However, no evidence is provided to verify $D$ is small.",0,,,,
"Thus, the claim in Theorem 1 does not hold. Moreover, without any knowledge regarding $D$, the bound for $s$ is useless. ",0,,,,
"Regarding experiments, an important baseline is missed.",1,1,,,
"The definition of the edge existence signal f is not clear (e.g., Eq. 2).",0,,,,
But it's not clearly mentioned in Section 4.1.,0,,,,
"Similarly, how to compute the conditional probability in Eq. 5 is also not clear. ",0,,,,
"Usually in graph learning (especially GCNs), receptive field denotes the nodes that are used for aggregations.",0,,,,
"The paper claims the proposed FTSE has a larger receptive field, but didn't give the reason.",0,,,,
" The proposed method actually remove the dependencies between two timestamps, which are usually very important information to capture the network dynamics.",0,,,,
The notations are inconsistent.,1,1,,,
"Based on this, I think the complexity analysis in Appendix C is not fair.",0,,,,
"It is unclear how the training/testing images were scored and under what criteria, which would be useful for understanding the good/bad rating system.",0,,,,
"While segmentation QC is a valuable tool, summarizing the entire segmentation quality into a single binary good/bad may not be useful for practical use.",0,,,,
"Currently, it almost seems as though the architecture and hyperparameters for the 2D CNN were chosen based on the same set in which policies were evaluated, which would be problematic ",0,,,,
"The result is however quite preliminary as the paper merely showed the performance without properly explaining why such a design works, even with empirical study.",1,,1,1,
"Thus, it is not clear where the performance gain actually from.",0,,,,
They basically plainly applied Zhang et al. (2019)'s bidirectional target networks with minimum of the critic ensemble.,1,,1,,
"The paper evaluates the segmentation performance of an algorithm over increasingly reduced CT imaging counts, but does not provide any methodological innovation.",0,1,,,
The paper does not provide any details as to the deep learning segmentation method used.,0,,,,
It is also unclear how the algorithm was trained for this task.,0,,,,
Enthusiasm for the results is also limited due to testing on n=5 images.,1,,1,1,
The submission needs additional ablation studies to understand the proposed method,1,1,,,
"However, this is a clear sign that something is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with the motivation of the method as currently presented, or that it needs to be modified to fix this issue.",1,1,,1,
It is not clear from the presented experimental results that the improved efficacy of the proposed method over its competitors is due to a better step-size selection.,0,,,,
"The inclusion of the norm of the weights of the model is justified as a proxy for its state, but it is poorly motivated.",0,,,,
"- The plots indicating `Iteration 0` do no contain the values of the model at iteration 0, as they should all start at the same accuracy at initialization.",0,,,,
The exact way neural style transfer was applied wasn't the most clearly explained.,0,0,,,
Nit: the last sentence of the abstract is a bit too terse and only makes sense after having read the paper.,0,,,,
"Although this is an interesting first step, many of the design choices seem a bit restrictive for more general image generation tasks.",0,,,,
The model description is confusing and lots of statements are presented without appropriate or enough justification.,1,1,,,
"(2) in the first paragraph of page 3, it says ""we define d_j as the BoW vector summarizing only the preceding sentences"", without further information, I have no idea what a BoW vector looks like or how it is constructed",0,,,,
"(3) in the last paragraph of page 3, it says using Dirichlet priors to make ""the latent representation more identifiable and interpretable, but also facilitates inference"", which I really don't know what it means.",0,,,,
"More importantly, I think Eq. (5) is wrong, which makes me question their whole methodology",1,1,,1,
"The authors do not clearly state their methodology, including the concrete architecture of the transformer-based model, and the training loss for optimizing the model.",0,,,,
"Overall this paper does not have enough technical contributions, so I vote for a clear reject.",1,,,1,
It is slightly unclear to me how negative vaccine intent examples were labeled.,0,,,,
"In section 3, No significant difference ''' ""were found"" is repeated twice.",0,,,,
The proposed approach has a number of serious drawbacks. ,1,,,1,
"This limits the scope of the method, due to the assumption that all centres of intervertebral discs are located in close proximity around the middle slice.",0,,,,
It is also not clear what the slice thickness is and thus how the image generated by averaging middle slices looks like.,0,,,,
"The term ""labelling"" of the intervertebral disc might not be correctly used in this work.",0,,,,
"However, I'm missing a deeper discussion on the benefit of an object-centric solution.",0,,,,
The authors mention that ARGA is performing better than the baseline on object movement tasks but then focus on why it performs worse on the others.,0,,,,
"Unfortunately, the evaluation lacks appropriate cross-validation.",1,1,,,
"Furthermore, related object-centric work is missing.",0,,,,
There are a couple of major issues about the content and the significance of the results presented in this paper.,1,,,1,
"While the paper is beautifully organized and easy to follow, I consider the scientific contributions of the work to be limited.",0,,,,
"In the CNF setting, Table 2, I do not see a major improvement in NFE.",,,,,
This paper is a 10 out of 10 as a blog post for the users of the adjoint method for training neural ODEs.,1,1,,,
I believe that the contribution of this paper is limited to a software hack that would benefit the community best if presented as a blog post. ,1,1,,,1
The main weakness of the work is the extremely poor writing quality.,1,1,,1,1
"There is spelling, grammar, and wording issues throughout (see Comments for some examples).",0,,,,
"The writing is sufficiently poor that it makes the specifics of the proposed method difficult to understand, and aspects of the experiments hard to interpret.",1,,,1,
"Due to the poor writing, some details are also not made clear.",1,,,1,
It is not specified that the work is number one on the leaderboard for the unlimited keypoints and standard descriptors.,1,,,1,
"In addition, the work fails to discuss and reference the other works that appears in Table 3 (Luca et al, Jiahui et al, Ximin et al are not included in the reference).",1,1,,,
"It's unclear what works these refers to (Luca et al, should be Cavalli et al, AdaLAM: Revisiting Handcrafted Outlier Detection, 2020)",0,,,,
"It's not clear what the FRP95 metric is that is show in Table 2, Figure 6.  Note that several metrics described in section 4.1 (%Rep., %M.S., %mATE, %FPT) does not appear to be reported on in the paper.",0,,,,
I am very confused however about the point of the problem you are trying to solve.,1,1,,1,
Would a superior method here not just be to take this brain information directly.,1,1,,,
"I see no point in altering the face of the scans as the face information will be useless for any downstream task, and all other information is apparently preserved, so why not just take this preserved data as the privacy preserving MRI information?",1,1,,,1
"However, from the knowledge I posses in the field I do not think the approach has merit due to superior, trivial baselines.",1,,,,1
"However, I feel that the paper is poorly structured, lacks depth, and ultimately, is difficult to follow.",1,,,1,
"Based purely on the main text, however, I would have to recommend *reject.*",1,1,,,
It is unfortunate that the reader must infer this link themselves.,1,1,,,
The soundness of the result in the paper was one of my main concerns.,0,,,,
The authors did not cover much of the related work in the main text.,0,,,,
This is an regrettable omission.,1,1,,,
The main text is very short and poorly structured.,1,,,1,
